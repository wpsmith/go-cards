The four [French playing cards][3] suits used primarily in the English-speaking world: diamonds (♦), clubs (♣), hearts (♥) and spades (♠)

In [playing cards][4], a **suit** is one of several categories into which the **cards** of a deck are divided. Most often, each card bears one of several [pips][5] (symbols) showing to which suit it belongs; the suit may alternatively or additionally be indicated by the color printed on the card. The _rank_ for each card is determined by the number of pips on it, except on [face cards][6]. Ranking indicates which cards within a suit are better, higher or more valuable than others, whereas there is no order between the suits unless defined in the rules of a specific [card game][7]. Unless playing with multiple decks, there is exactly one card of any given rank in any given suit. A deck may include special cards that belong to no suit, often called [jokers][8].

## History[[edit][9]]

Various languages have different terminology for suits such as colors, signs, or seeds. Modern Western playing cards are generally divided into two or three general suit-systems. The older Latin suits are subdivided into the [Italian][10] and [Spanish][11] suit-systems. The younger Germanic suits are subdivided into the [German][12] and [Swiss][13] suit-systems. The [French suits][3] are a derivative of the German suits but are generally considered a separate system on its own.[[1]][14][[2]][15]

### Origin and development of the Latin suits[[edit][16]]

The Latin suits consist of coins, clubs, cups, and swords. They are the earliest suit-system in Europe, having been adopted from the cards imported from [Mamluk Egypt][17] and [Moorish Granada][18] in the 1370s. These Turko-Arabic cards, called Kanjifa, employed the same suits, but the clubs represented polo sticks. Europeans changed that suit as [polo][19] was an obscure sport to them. Ultimately the suits can trace their roots back to China where playing cards were first invented. The earliest [card games][7] were [trick-taking games][20] and the invention of suits increased the level of strategy and depth in these games. A card of one suit cannot beat a card from another regardless of its rank. The concept of suits predate playing cards and can be found in Chinese dice and domino games such as [Tien Gow][21].

[Chinese money-suited cards][22] are believed to be the oldest ancestor to the Latin suit-system. The money-suit system is based on [denominations of currency][23]: [**Coins][24]**, **Strings** of Coins, [**Myriads][25]** of Strings, and **Tens** of Myriads. Old Chinese coins had holes in the middle to allow them to be strung together. A string of coins could easily be misinterpreted as a stick to those unfamiliar with them. The Mamluks called their suit of cups Myriads and this may have been due to inverting the Chinese character for myriad ([万][26]). The Mamluk suit of swords may also have been inspired by the Chinese numeral for Ten ([十][27]).[[3]][28] Another clue linking these Chinese, Muslim, and European cards are the ranking of certain suits. In many early Chinese games like [Madiao][29], the suit of coins was in reverse order so that the lower ones beat the higher ones. In the Indo-Persian game of [Ganjifa][30], half the suits were also inverted, including a suit of coins. This was also true for the European games of [Tarot][31] and [Ombre][32]. The inverting of suits had no purpose in regards to gameplay but was an artifact from the earliest games.

There are four types of Latin suits: Italian, Spanish, Portuguese[[c]][33], and an extinct archaic type.[[4]][34][[5]][35] The systems can be distinguished by the pips of their long suits: swords and clubs. Italian swords are curved outward and the clubs appear to be batons. They intersect one another. Spanish swords are straight, and the clubs appear to be knobbly cudgels. They do not cross each other. Portuguese pips are like the Spanish, but they intersect like Italian ones. They sometimes have dragons on the [aces][36].[[6]][37] This system lingers on only in the [Tarocco Siciliano][38] and the [Unsun Karuta][39] of Japan. The archaic system[[d]][40] is like the Italian one, but the swords are curved inward so they touch each other without intersecting.[[7]][41][[8]][42][Minchiate][43] used a mixed system of Italian clubs and Portuguese swords.

Despite a long history of trade with China, [Japan][44] was introduced to playing cards with the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1540s. Early locally made cards, [Karuta][45], were very similar to Portuguese decks. Increasing restrictions by the [Tokugawa shogunate][46] on gambling, card playing, and general foreign influence, resulted in the [Hanafuda][47] card deck that today is used most often for fishing-type games. The role of rank and suit in organizing cards became switched, so the hanafuda deck has 12 suits, each representing a month of the year, and each suit has 4 cards, most often two normal, one Ribbon and one Special (though August, November and December each differ uniquely from this convention).

### Invention of the Germanic suits[[edit][48]]

During the 15th-century, manufacturers in German speaking lands experimented with various new suit systems to replace the Latin suits. One early deck had five suits, the Latin ones with an extra suit of shields.[[9]][49] The Swiss-Germans developed their own suits of shields, roses, acorns, and bells around 1450.[[10]][50] Instead of roses and shields, the Germans settled with hearts and leaves around 1460. The French derived their suits of _trèfles_ (clovers or clubs ♣), _carreaux_ (tiles or diamonds ♦), _cœurs_ (hearts ♥), and _piques_ (pikes or spades ♠) from the German suits around 1480. French suits correspond closely with German suits with the exception of the tiles with the bells but there is one early French deck that had crescents instead of tiles. The English names for the French suits of clubs and spades may simply have been carried over from the older Latin suits.[[11]][51]

### Tarot[[edit][52]]

Beginning around 1440 in northern Italy, some decks started to include of an extra suit of (usually) 21 numbered cards known as [trionfi][53] or [trumps][54], to play [tarot card games][31].[[12]][55] Always included in [tarot][56] decks is one card, [the Fool or Excuse][57], which may be part of the trump suit depending on the game or region. These cards do not have pips or face cards like the other suits. Most tarot decks used for games come with French suits but Italian suits are still used in Piedmont, Bologna, and pockets of Switzerland. A few Sicilian towns use the Portuguese-suited [Tarocco Siciliano][38], the only deck of its kind left in Europe.

## Suits in games with traditional decks[[edit][58]]

### Trumps[[edit][59]]

In a large and popular category of [trick-taking games][20], one suit may be designated in each deal to be [_trump][54]_ and all cards of the trump suit rank above all non-trump cards, and automatically prevail over them, losing only to a higher trump if one is played to the same trick.[[13]][60] Non-trump suits are called plain suits.[[14]][61]

### Special suits[[edit][62]]

Some games treat one or more suits as being special or different from the others. A simple example is [Spades][63], which uses spades as a permanent trump suit. A less simple example is [Hearts][64], which is a kind of [point trick game][20] in which the object is to avoid taking tricks containing hearts. With typical rules for Hearts (rules vary slightly) the queen of spades and the two of clubs (sometimes also the jack of diamonds) have special effects, with the result that all four suits have different strategic value. [Tarot][56] decks have a dedicated trump suit.

### Ranking of suits[[edit][65]]

Whist-style rules generally preclude the necessity of determining which of two cards of different suits has higher rank, because a card played on a card of a different suit either automatically wins or automatically loses depending on whether the new card is a trump. However, some card games also need to define relative suit rank. An example of this is in auction games such as [bridge][66], where if one player wishes to bid to make some number of heart tricks and another to make the same number of diamond tricks, there must be a mechanism to determine which takes precedence in the bidding order.

As there is no truly standard way to order the four suits, each game that needs to do so has its own convention; however, the ubiquity of bridge has gone some way to make its ordering a _de facto_ standard. Typical orderings of suits include (from highest to lowest):

* [Bridge][66] _(for bidding and scoring)_ and [occasionally poker][67]: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs; 'notrump' ranks above all the suits[[_clarification needed][68]_]
* [Preferans][69]: hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades. Only used for bidding, and No Trump [[_clarification needed][68]_] is considered higher than hearts.
* [Five Hundred][70]: hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades _(for bidding and scoring)_
* [Ninety-nine][71]: clubs, hearts, spades, diamonds _(supposedly [mnemonic][72] as they have respectively 3, 2, 1, 0 lobes; see article for how this scoring is used)_
* [Skat][73]: clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds _(for bidding and to determine which Jack beats which in play)_
* [Big Two][74]: spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds _([Presidents and Arseholes][75] reverses suit strength: hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs)_
* [Teen patti][76]: In the case where two players have flushes with cards of the same rank, the winning hand is based on suit color as ranked by clubs, hearts, spades, diamonds.
* [Thirteen][77]: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades (in descending order).

### Pairing or ignoring suits[[edit][78]]

The pairing of suits is a vestigial remnant of [Ganjifa][30], a game where half the suits were in reverse order, the lower cards beating the higher. In Ganjifa, progressive suits were called "strong" while inverted suits were called "weak". In Latin decks, the traditional division is between the long suits of swords and clubs and the round suits of cups and coins. This pairing can be seen in [Ombre][32] and [Tarot card games][31]. German and Swiss suits lack pairing but French suits maintained them and this can be seen in the game of [Spoil Five][79].[[15]][80]

In some games, such as [blackjack][81], suits are ignored. In other games, such as [Canasta][82], only the color (red or black) is relevant. In yet others, such as bridge, each of the suit pairings are distinguished.

Fundamentally, there are three ways to divide four suits into pairs: by _color_, by _rank_ and by _shape_ resulting in six possible suit combinations.

* Color is used to denote the _red_ suits (hearts and diamonds) and the _black_ suits (spades and clubs).
* Rank is used to indicate the [_major][83]_ (spades and hearts) versus [_minor][84]_ (diamonds and clubs) suits.
* Shape is used to denote the _pointed_ (diamonds and spades, which visually have a sharp point uppermost) versus _rounded_ (hearts and clubs) suits.

In the event of widespread introduction of [four-color decks][85], it has been suggested that the red/black distinction could be replaced by _pointed bottoms_ (hearts and diamonds visually have a sharp point downwards, whereas spades and clubs have a blunt stem).

### Four-color suits[[edit][86]]

![][87]

Some decks, while using the French suits, give each suit a different color to make the suits more distinct from each other. In [bridge][66], such decks are known as _no-[revoke][88]_ decks, and the most common colors are black spades, red hearts, blue diamonds and green clubs, although in the past the diamond suit usually appeared in a golden yellow-orange. A pack occasionally used in Germany uses green spades (compare to leaves), red hearts, yellow diamonds (compare to bells) and black clubs (compare to acorns). This is a compromise deck devised to allow players from East Germany (who used German suits) and West Germany (who adopted the French suits) to be comfortable with the same deck when playing tournament [Skat][73] after the [German reunification][89].[[16]][90]

Numerous variations of the 52-card French deck have existed over the years. Most notably, [Tarot Nouveau][91] has a separate trump series in addition to the four suits; however this _fifth suit_ is a series of cards of a different number and style than the suited cards. There have been many attempts at expanding the French deck to five, six or even more suits where the additional suits have the same number and style of cards as the French suits, and have proposed rules for expanded versions of popular games such as [rummy][92], [hearts][64], [bridge][66], and [poker][93] that could be played with such a deck.

In 1895, Hiram Jones of the United States created one of the earliest decks with extra suits called _International Playing Cards_. In addition to the four standard French suits, it had two additional suits, red crosses and black bullets. (The bullets of that period were spherical, hence the pip was a circle.)[[17]][94]

In the summer of 1937 in Vienna, [Walter W. Marseille][95], with the help of [Paul Stern][96], published rules for five-suit bridge which included a fifth suit of green Leaves, taken from [German-suited William Tell cards][97].[[18]][98][[19]][99][[20]][100][[21]][101] This set off a fad for five-suited decks which would last until the end of 1938.

[De La Rue][102] of London published packs called _Five-Suit Bridge Playing Cards_. This deck contained cards using blue crowns called Royals as a fifth suit. In the new suit, the court cards used the [Paris pattern's][103] heart suit designs. [Waddingtons][104]' print was like De La Rue's with the exception of more detailed Royal crown pips. They also published several decks that used green crowns but the face cards for that suit were a duplicate of other English pattern suits. Due to unpopularity, they were withdrawn in 1939.[[22]][105] These packs arrived in the US on March 1938.[[23]][106]

American manufacturers responded with a green _Eagle_ as the fifth suit to avoid paying royalties as the Royals were copyrighted.[[24]][107][[17]][94] The deck published by [United States Playing Card Company][108] (USPCC) had a medium green Eagle and the pips in the corner index were inside green circles. A second deck was by Russell Playing Cards (owned by the USPCC) used the same Eagle but in a darker shade and the pips in the corner index were devoid of the circle. These two decks reused the club courts for the new suit. A third deck was made by Arrco which had a different Eagle and reused the spade courts. At least six bridge books were subsequently published to support playing bridge with rules for this fifth suit by authors such as [Oswald Jacoby][109], [P. Hal Sims][110] and [Howard Schenken][111]. It is more than likely the book that Arrco published was for their own deck. The title of a 1952 science-fiction novel by [James Blish][112], _Jack of Eagles_, refers to the main character being _different_.

Also in 1938, [Parker Brothers][113] created a five-suit bridge deck called _Castle Bridge_, in which the fifth suit of Castles looked like a [Rook][114] chess piece and was colored green. This pack reused the diamond courts for the new suit.[[17]][94] The manual that came with this deck did not use Marseille's rules but Ammiel F. Decker's 1933 rules.[[25]][115]

### Five-suit decks[[edit][116]]

#### Historical decks[[edit][117]]

In the mid to late 1930s there was an increase in the popularity of [bridge][66]. Thought up one summer night by Austrian gamester Walther Marseille, Ph.D., rules were first devised for a fifth suit based on a _green_ or invulnerable suit. In 1937, a book for rules using the fifth suit was written in [Vienna][118], Austria, and patented for this set of rules. This fifth suit was produced by a number of companies. In 1935, [De La Rue][102] of Great Britain created a Bridge deck called _De La Rue's Five Suit Contract Bridge Playing Cards_. This deck contained cards using grey-blue colored crowns called _Royals_ as a fifth suit. According to the rules published by Parker Brothers, credit is given to Ammiel F. Decker for the rules in 1933. The fifth suit of _Greens_ was called _Blätter_, or leaves. In 1937 and 1938, Waddington's of London created a fifth suit of more detailed crowns also called _Royals_, which respectively featured light blue and dark green crowns. In the same year there were three American decks that included a green _Eagle_ as a fifth suit in similar Bridge decks of playing cards. The deck published by [United States Playing Card Company][108] used the Eagle in a medium green and the pips in the corners were inside green circles. The second deck was by Russell Playing Cards (owned by the [United States Playing Card Company][108]) used the same Eagle but in a darker shade and the pips in the corners were devoid of the circle. The third deck was by Arrco in 1938 and used an Eagle as well. At least five other bridge books were subsequently published to support playing Bridge with rules for this fifth suit, including one by Arrco in 1938. It is more than likely the book that Arrco published was for their own deck. [Parker Brothers][113] created a fifth-suit Bridge deck in 1938 called _Castle Bridge_, in which the fifth suit of Castles looked like a [Rook][114] chess piece and was colored green. After 1938, the popularity of this fifth suit fell off and the decks were no longer produced for Bridge. The title of a science-fiction novel by [James Blish][112], _Jack of Eagles_, refers to the main character being _different_.

A number of the following out-of-print decks may be found, especially through on-line auctions. Previously, Five Star Playing Cards poker sized, was manufactured by Five Star Games, which had a gold colored fifth suit of five pointed stars. The court cards are almost identical to the diamond suit in a Gemaco Five-Star deck. Five-suit decks using the Star suit are still in print in differing designs through vendors such as Stardeck and Newton's Novelties. Cadaco manufactured a game _Tripoley Wild_ with a fifth suit, (and other Wild Cards,) which contain [pips][5] of all four standard suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs) on one card. That poker sized deck is not sold separately, but as part of boxed game. Five suited decks include Cinco-Loco Poker Playing Cards, produced by the USA Playing Card Company (not the [United States Playing Card Company][108],) which introduces a new suit design. The Cinco-Loco fifth suit uses a complicated pattern, with color designs in a repeating circular series of pentagrams with four traditional suits in a four color pattern, inner circles get increasingly smaller, the fifth symbol in the circle of pentagrams is a yellow pentagram. There are then a total of ten symbols in each of the outer and repeated in inner circles. The other suits use a four-color design.

_5° Dimension_ is an 80-card deck introduced in 2007. The five suits are Hearts (red), Spades (black), Clubs (green), Diamonds (yellow) and Stars (blue). Each suit has 16 cards: 1 to 10, King, Queen, Jack, Princess, Ace (distinct from 1) and a Joker.

#### Commercial decks[[edit][119]]

A commercially available five-suit poker (65-card) deck is Stardeck, introduced in 1938, which introduces _stars_ as a fifth suit. In the Stardeck cards, the fifth suit is colored a mixture of black and red. This fifth suit can be counted as either a Red or a Black suit dependent upon the game being played. There are also 2 _special_ cards (or Jokers) 1 each of red and black and shown with that colour star in the corner, but no numeral or letter.

_Estate Playing Cards_ designed in 2006, is a contemporary five-suit (62-card) deck which adds a fifth suit (estate) called Waves. Estate cards signifies the five estates identified as Waves (green), Hearts (red), Diamonds (orange), Clubs (blue) and Spades (black). The three Royals are replaced with two Family - Man and Woman. Jokers are replaced with Imperials (Pope and President). Most games can be played, however they become more involved. 5 Card Poker traditionally has over 2 million possible hands with Royal Flush as the lowest probability. Estate Poker has 5,461,512 possible hands with Family Flush as the lowest probability and new hands such as Five of a Kind.

[_Five Crowns][120]_ is yet another five-suited deck similar to that of _5° Dimension_, The suits are Hearts (red), Spades (black), Clubs (green), Diamonds (blue) and Stars (yellow) with no-revoke suits. The deck contains 3 Jokers but does not contain aces or twos, making the card count per deck 58.

### Six-suit decks[[edit][121]]

#### Historical decks[[edit][122]]

In America in 1895, Hiram Jones created a deck called _International Playing Cards_ and it had two additional suits, a red suit with crosses and a black suit of bullets. (The bullets of that period were spherical, hence the pip was a circle.) Other attempts over the years experimented with either suit substitutions or additional suits added to decks of playing cards. Most of these did not last long, but some such as Civil War era card decks enjoyed limited success and are reprinted today.

Out of print is the Nu-Dek Sextet Bridge deck (copyright Ralph E. Peterson 1964, 1966), manufactured for Sextet Contract Bridge Associates ("SECOBRA") by the [United States Playing Card Company][108]. Two blue suits are added to the standard four: Rackets being a pair of crossed tennis rackets, and Wheels from a ship's steering wheel design.

Another out of print six-suited (78-card) deck of poker sized playing cards is the Empire Deck, introduced in 1990. It has three red suits and three black suits, introducing crowns in red and anchors in black as in the dice game [Crown and Anchor][123].

#### Commercial decks[[edit][124]]

_Deck6_ is a six-suited deck with three red suits (hearts, diamonds, shields), three black suits (clubs, spades, cups) and three jokers (total 81 cards).

A six-suited (120-card) deck of poker sized playing cards is the K6T deck. The traditional suits are colored (green clubs and orange diamonds) and are completed with blue moons and purple stars. Each suit has 20 cards ranked as 0(=Joker)-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-J-C(Cavalier)-B(Bishop)-R(Rook)-Q-K-Ace.

### Eight-suit decks[[edit][125]]

#### Commercial decks[[edit][126]]

_8 Suits Playing Cards_, conceived in the late 1970s and manufactured through BrienmarK Products Inc., adds red Moons, black Stars, red four-leaved Clovers and black Tears. This deck was originally created to allow more players in a game of [euchre][127].

_The Fat Pack_ adds red Roses, black Axes, black Tridents and red Doves to the standard deck.

_Toss™ Double Deluxe Decks_ consists of the traditional French suits plus gold Crosses and Oracles, blue Castles and Shields, five Jokers (one for each color plus a Boss Joker) and two Null cards.

## Other suited decks[[edit][128]]

### Suited-and-ranked decks[[edit][129]]

A large number of games are based around a deck in which each card has a rank and a suit (usually represented by a color), and for each suit there is exactly one card having each rank, though in many cases the deck has various special cards as well. Examples include Mü und Mehr, [Lost Cities][130], DUO, Sticheln, [Rage][131], Schotten Totten, [UNO][132], [_Phase 10][133]_, Oh-No!, [Skip-Bo][134], and [Rook][135].

### Other modern decks[[edit][136]]

Decks for some games are divided into suits, but otherwise bear little relation to traditional games. An example would be the board game [Taj Mahal][137], in which each card has one of four background colors, the rule being that all the cards played by a single player in a single round must be the same color. The selection of cards in the deck of each color is approximately the same and the player's choice of which color to use is guided by the contents of their particular hand.

Roodles, a game published in 1912 by A.J. Patterson of [Kalamazoo][138] and later by Flinch Card Co., uses a deck with 14 cards in each of four suits (all black) – Wishbones, Horseshoes, 4-Leaf Clovers, and Swastikas – plus a joker labeled "Roodles". Roodles was described on its box cover as simple, instructive, scientific and entertaining.

In the trick-taking card game _Flaschenteufel_ ("[The Bottle Imp][139]"), all cards are part of a single sequence ranked from 1 to 37 but split into three suits depending on its rank. players must follow the suit led, but if they are void in that suit they may play a card of another suit _and this can still win the trick if its rank is high enough_. For this reason every card in the deck has a different number to prevent ties. A further strategic element is introduced since one suit contains mostly low-ranking cards and another, mostly high-ranking cards.

Whereas cards in a traditional deck have two classifications—suit and rank—and each combination is represented by one card, giving for example _4 suits × 13 ranks = 52 cards_, each card in a [Set][140] deck has four classifications each into one of three categories, giving a total of _3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81_ cards. Any one of these four classifications could be considered a _suit_, but this is not really enlightening in terms of the structure of the game.

### Fictional decks[[edit][141]]

Several people have invented decks which are not meant to be seriously played. The [Double Fanucci][142] deck from [_Zork][143]_ takes the most imaginative licence with the suits: it has no fewer than fifteen, with the names Mazes, Books, Rain, Bugs, Fromps, Inkblots, Scythes, Plungers, Faces, Time, Lamps, Hives, Ears, Zurfs, and Tops.

The [Cripple Mr. Onion][144] deck uses eight fictional suits, but may be simulated by combining the standard French suits with the traditional Latin suited ones or by using a modern 8-suited deck.

The [Discordian][145] deck is a [parody][146] of the Tarot deck, its five suits corresponding to the five Discordian elements.

The card game of sabacc from the [_Star Wars][147]_ universe has the suits of staves, flasks, sabers, and coins (similar to Latin suits), with cards ranked one through fifteen, plus two each of eight other cards which have no suit.

The deck used in [_Firefly][148]_ has suits of Plum, Peach, Orange, Apple, Apricot, and Banana.

In [World of Warcraft][149], there are cards that randomly drop from humanoid enemies. If a player collected the entire suit, he/she could trade it for a trinket that would grant special abilities. Initially, this was limited to the ace through eight of the suits of Elementals, Beasts, Warlords, and Portals. A later content patch added the suits of Lunacy, Storms, Furies, and Blessings. The Inscription skill allowed the crafting of cards of the suits of Mages, Swords, Rogues, and Demons.

In [Robert Asprin][150]'s [MythAdventures][151] series, [Dragon Poker][152] is played using a standard deck, but with the suits consisting of elves, ogres, unicorns and dragons.

## Uses of playing card suit symbols[[edit][153]]

Card suit symbols occur in places outside card playing:

## Character encodings[[edit][154]]

In computer and another [digital media][155], suit symbols are represented with [character encoding][156], notably in the [ISO][157] and [Unicode][158] standards, and as [Web standard][159] ([SGML][160]'s named entity "&name;" [syntax][161]):

## Metaphorical uses[[edit][167]]

In some card games the card suits have a dominance order: club (lowest) - diamond - heart - spade (highest). That led to _in spades_ being used to mean _more than expected, in abundance, very much_.[[27]][168]

Other expressions drawn from bridge and similar games include _strong suit_ (any area of personal strength) and _follow suit_ (to imitate another's actions).

15. **[^][185]** The shape of the clubs symbol is believed to be an adaptation of the German suit of acorns. Clubs are also known as clovers, flowers and crosses. The French name for the suit is _trèfles_ meaning _clovers_, the Italian name for the suit is _fiori_ meaning _flowers_ and the German name for the suit is _Kreuz_ meaning _cross_.
16. **[^][186]** In the Germanic countries the spade was the symbol associated with the blade of a [spade][187]. The English term _spade_ originally did not refer to the tool but was derived from the Spanish word _espada_ meaning _[sword][188]_ from the Spanish suit. Those symbols were later changed to resemble the digging tool instead to avoid confusion. In German and Dutch the suit is alternatively named _Schippen_ and _schoppen_ respectively, meaning [shovels][189].
